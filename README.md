# Deez Meds
Dee has a bottle of 28 pills
I need to divide the pills between me, his mom, and his daycare
He takes one in the morning an one at lunch (so the pills will last for 14 days)
Monday to Friday, he's at daycare, and the daycare worker will give him one pill at lunch
His mom has him Friday night, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday morning
I have him Tuesday night, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday morning
How many pills does each person get?
